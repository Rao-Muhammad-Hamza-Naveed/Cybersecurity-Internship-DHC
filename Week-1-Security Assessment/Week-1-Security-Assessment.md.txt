# Week 1 – Security Assessment Report

## Introduction
The objective of this task is to perform a basic security assessment of a Node.js-based web application and identify common web vulnerabilities.

## Application Overview
The application used for this assessment is OWASP Juice Shop. It is a deliberately vulnerable Node.js application designed for security testing and awareness.

## Methodology
Manual testing techniques were used to assess the application. Common payloads were injected into user input fields to test for vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.

## Vulnerabilities Tested

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Stored XSS was tested through the feedback feature. A JavaScript payload was injected and successfully executed when the feedback page was reloaded.

### 2. SQL Injection
SQL Injection payloads were tested on the login form. Authentication bypass was attempted using common SQL payloads.

### 3. Weak Authentication
Weak passwords were accepted during the registration process, indicating a lack of strong password enforcement.

## Evidence
Screenshots related to the testing and findings are provided in the screenshots folder.

## Tools Used
- Web Browser
- Manual Testing

## Conclusion
The assessment revealed several security weaknesses, including Stored XSS and weak authentication mechanisms. These issues highlight the need for secure input handling and proper validation.
