# Week 2 – Security Measures Implementation & Analysis

## Objective
To analyze common web application vulnerabilities
using OWASP Juice Shop and demonstrate how
industry-standard security measures mitigate them.

---

## 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
**Concept:** validator.js

Input validation prevents attackers from injecting
malicious payloads into application inputs.

### Demonstration
A script injection payload was entered into the
search functionality of the application, resulting
in script execution.

### Mitigation Explanation
In a production environment, libraries such as
validator.js validate and sanitize inputs before
processing.

## 2. Password Hashing
**Concept:** bcrypt

Storing passwords in plaintext exposes users to
credential theft in case of database compromise.

### Explanation
bcrypt applies a one-way hashing function, ensuring
passwords cannot be reversed.

## 3. Token-Based Authentication
**Concept:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JWT enables stateless authentication by issuing a
signed token after successful login.

### Observation
The authentication token is stored in the browser
after login.

### Risk & Mitigation
Improper token storage may lead to token theft.
Secure storage mechanisms and expiration policies
are recommended.

## 4. Secure HTTP Headers
**Concept:** Helmet.js

HTTP security headers protect applications against
clickjacking, XSS, and MIME-type attacks.

### Explanation
Helmet configures headers such as:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the importance of applying
security best practices to reduce common web
application vulnerabilities.
