# Week 2 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Assessment

## Objective
The objective of this task was to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop.

## Vulnerability Type
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Payload Used
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

## Affected Component
Search functionality of the OWASP Juice Shop application.

## Description
The search input reflects user input back into the page without proper sanitization.
By injecting a malicious HTML payload using an image tag with an event handler, JavaScript code was successfully executed.

## Impact
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser, which may lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Credential theft
- Defacement
- Phishing attacks

## Mitigation
- Proper input validation
- Output encoding
- Use of Content Security Policy (CSP)
